# Switch Java Version (SJV)

This repository contains two scripts, `sjv.bat` and `sjv.ps1`, designed to simplify switching between different Java Development Kits (JDKs) on Windows systems.

## About
Had to take CS2103 in Java 11, and teach CS2030 in Java 17, so here is a helpful utility if you are in a similar situation! 
Currently, it only supports switching between jdk-11 and jdk-17.

The scripts were inspired by [Prakash Boda](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5259214/prakash-boda) on StackOverflow.
README generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

## Usage & Installation

Run `sjv` followed by the desired JDK version as an argument:

- For JDK 11:
  ```sh
  sjv 11
  ```

- For JDK 17:
  ```sh
  sjv 17
  ``` 

### Adding to System Environment Path (Recommended)
To make the scripts accessible from any directory, you can add the path to this repository to the system environment `PATH`. Here's how:

1. Clone this repo to (your/preferred/file/path/sjv).

2. Go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.

3. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

4. In the "System Variables" section, select the `Path` variable and click "Edit".

5. Click "New" and add the path to the directory (your/preferred/file/path/sjv/) containing the `sjv.bat` and `sjv.ps1` scripts.

6. Click "OK" to save the changes.

Now you can use the scripts from any directory by simply typing `sjv` in the command prompt or PowerShell.
